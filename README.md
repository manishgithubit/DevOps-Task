# DevOps-Task
Here is the complete DevOps task:

# Step 1: Create a Kubernetes cluster in AWS which runs a Node.js service
To create a Kubernetes cluster in AWS, we will use the Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS).

Prerequisites
- AWS account
- AWS CLI installed
- kubectl installed
- Docker installed


* Create an EKS cluster using the AWS CLI: aws eks create-cluster --name my-cluster --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/eks-service-role

* Wait for the cluster to be created:  aws eks describe-cluster --name my-cluster --query 'cluster.status'

* Update the kubeconfig file:  aws eks update-kubeconfig --name my-cluster --region us-west-2

* Build the Docker image:  docker build -t my-nodejs-service .

* Push the Docker image to Docker Hub:  docker tag my-nodejs-service:latest <your-docker-hub-username>/my-nodejs-service:latest and docker push <your-docker-hub-username>/my-nodejs-service:latest

* Create a new file called deployment.yaml and Apply the deployment YAML file:  kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

* Verify that the deployment is running:  kubectl get deployments

# Step 2: Implement scalability, CI/CD pipeline, secrets management, scalability testing, and SSL certificate

# a. Scalability

To make the service scalable, we can use Kubernetes' built-in scaling features:

- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA): automatically scales the number of replicas based on CPU utilization.
- Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA): automatically scales the resources (CPU and memory) allocated to a pod.

Create a new file called hpa.yaml

Apply the HPA YAML file:

kubectl apply -f hpa.yaml

Verify that the HPA is running:

kubectl get hpa


# b. CI/CD pipeline

To implement a CI/CD pipeline, we can use the following tools:

Step 1: Commit New Code
- Developer commits new code to the Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- The commit triggers a webhook that notifies the CI/CD pipeline.

Step 2: Build and Test
- The CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD) checks out the code from the Git repository.
- The pipeline builds the code (e.g., npm install, npm run build).
- The pipeline runs automated tests (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).

Step 3: Create Docker Image
- The pipeline creates a Docker image for the application.
- The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

Step 4: Deploy to Staging
- The pipeline deploys the Docker image to a staging environment (e.g., Kubernetes cluster).
- The pipeline runs automated tests in the staging environment.

Step 5: Manual Review and Approval
- The pipeline notifies the development team that the code is ready for review.
- A developer reviews the code and verifies that it works as expected in the staging environment.
- The developer approves the code for deployment to production.

Step 6: Deploy to Production
- The pipeline deploys the Docker image to a production environment (e.g., Kubernetes cluster).
- The pipeline configures the production environment (e.g., sets environment variables).

Step 7: Monitor and Rollback
- The pipeline monitors the production environment for errors or issues.
- If issues are detected, the pipeline rolls back the deployment to a previous version.

# c. Storing and Deploying Secrets:

To store and deploy secrets such as API keys, I would use a combination of the following tools:

- Kubernetes Secrets:
  Kubernetes provides a built-in secret management feature that allows you to store sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, and certificates. Secrets are stored in an encrypted format and can be mounted as environment variables or files within containers.

- Hashicorp's Vault:
  Vault is a secrets management tool that provides a secure way to store and manage sensitive data. Vault can be integrated with Kubernetes to provide a centralized secrets management solution.

- External Secret Management Tools:
  Other external secret management tools such as AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager, or Azure Key Vault can also be used to store and manage secrets.

To deploy secrets, I would use Kubernetes' built-in secret management feature to create secrets and then mount them as environment variables or files within containers.

# d. Testing Infrastructure Scalability

To test how well the infrastructure scales when many requests come in, I would use a combination of the following tools and techniques:

- Monitoring and Logging Tools: Tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack can be used to monitor the application's performance and logs in real-time, providing insights into how well the infrastructure is scaling.

- Automated Scaling: Kubernetes' built-in horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) feature can be used to automatically scale the number of replicas based on CPU utilization or other custom metrics.

# e. Providing an SSL Certificate
To provide an SSL certificate for the service, I would use a combination of the following tools and techniques:

- Let's Encrypt: Let's Encrypt is a free, automated certificate authority that provides SSL/TLS certificates. Kubernetes' built-in cert-manager feature can be used to automatically obtain and renew certificates from Let's Encrypt.

- Kubernetes Ingress: Kubernetes' built-in ingress feature can be used to provide a single entry point for the application and manage SSL/TLS certificates.

- External Certificate Management Tools: Other external certificate management tools such as AWS Certificate Manager or Google Cloud Certificate Manager can also be used to obtain and manage SSL/TLS certificates.
